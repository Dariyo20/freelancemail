    "customizedPitch": "Hi Abiola,\n\nI'm David Ariyo, a Full Stack Developer who helps growing-business companies improve their online presence and customer conversion.\n\nI analyzed Enkay Indo Nigerian Industries Limited's website and found several opportunities that could impact your business:\n\n1. Add meta description - lower click-through rates from search results\n2. Implement main heading (H1) found - confusing for users and search engines\n3. Optimize website loading: 3.5s (should be under 3s) - losing potential customers\n\nFor an established small business (11-50 employees), addressing these areas will enhance customer experience and competitive positioning.\n\nMy recent projects include:\n• Building real-time web applications for Dassage (MERN stack)\n• Developing e-commerce solutions for DAstore with payment integration\n• Optimizing site performance resulting in 40%+ speed improvements\n\nCompanies in your industry typically see 25-50% improvements in web performance and user engagement.\n\nI can show you the exact steps to write meta descriptions that double your click-through rates - you'll see immediate results. Would you have 10 minutes this week for me to demonstrate the solution?\n\nBest regards,\nDavid Ariyo\nFull Stack Developer | MERN Specialist\nPhone: (+234) 903-6184-863\nEmail: davidariyo109@gmail.com\nPortfolio: davidariyo.onrender.com",
